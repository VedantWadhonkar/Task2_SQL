# Task2_SQL
# 📊 Sales Report Project (MySQL)

This project demonstrates how to generate **sales reports** using SQL queries in **MySQL Workbench**.  
The task includes creating a database, defining tables, inserting sample records, and writing queries to produce useful business insights.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

We created a database **SalesDB** with the following tables:  

- **customers** → Stores customer details  
- **products** → Stores product details and prices  
- **sales** → Stores sales transactions linked to customers and products

This includes:  
- 5 Customers (Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Emma)  
- 5 Products (Laptop, Mobile, Headphones, Keyboard, Mouse)  
- Sales transactions with quantities and total amounts
